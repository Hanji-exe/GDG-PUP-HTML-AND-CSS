  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> Hi, I’m Fahad Hadji Esmael, a freshman pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I’m passionate about technology and creativity, and I’m actively involved in various organizations that help me develop my tech skills. As a newest junior web developer in the Microsoft Student Community - PUP and a cadet in multiple groups, I’m focused on honing my expertise in web development. I’m also a creative member in PUP events, volunteering to design and contribute to impactful initiatives. Industrious, determined, and collaborative, I aim to grow as an effective young tech professional while inspiring others in the industry. In my free time, I enjoy exploring arts and design, researching new topics, and engaging with innovative ideas. </p>

  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <p> I spend a lot of my free time diving into things that make me happy and keep me grounded. My biggest passion is digital art—I absolutely love creating and experimenting with new ideas. It’s my favorite way to express myself and let my imagination work. When I’m feeling bored or just need a break, I usually watch videos. It’s my go-to for a quick mood boost and some entertainment. Editing is something I don’t do as often, but it’s a hobby that helps me sharpen my creative skills whenever I do it. And, of course, eating! Food is my ultimate comfort—it’s how I deal with stress and treat myself when life gets overwhelming. Staying connected with friends and the world through social media is another thing I enjoy; it helps me feel close to people and stay in the loop. These little things may seem simple, but they bring a lot of joy and balance to my life. </p>
